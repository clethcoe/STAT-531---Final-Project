## 1.10 Motivation and Data Description 

As reported by the New York Times, tuberculosis (TB) has reclaimed the title of the world’s leading infectious disease killer as of November 2023, after being briefly removed from its long reign by Covid-19. The World Health Organization reports that nearly 40 percent of people who are living with TB are untreated and undiagnosed. Deaths from tuberculosis remain pronounced, with 1.36 million people dying from tuberculosis in 2022. 

This project aims to better contextualize the relationship between a government spending and tuberculosis on a country-by-country basis. We hypothesize that the countries that spend more on healthcare per person also see fewer deaths from tuberculosis.

Two data sets were chosen for this analysis: 1) the estimated numbers of deaths caused by TB (all forms) among 100,000 residents during the given year from 2000 - 2015 sorted by country, and 2) the average health expenditures per person paid by government entities from 1995 - 2010 expressed in US dollars using the average exchange rate. 

The data sets were joined by country and only complete observations from 2000 - 2010 were included.

## 2.0 Data Visualization
```{r}

  )) +

## 2.1 Linear Regression
### 2.11 Visualization
```{r}
combined_dataset_long_cleaned |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = gov_health_spending_usd, 
    y = deaths_per_100k
  )) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
  

```
When examining the raw data for each year of each countries deaths per 100k and government spending, we can see that it is not a great fit for a linear regression model. 

```{r}
combined_dataset_long_cleaned |> 
  group_by(country) |> 
  summarise(mean_deaths = mean(deaths_per_100k), 
            mean_spending = mean(gov_health_spending_usd)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_deaths, y = mean_spending)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  xlab("Mean Government Spending in USD") + 
  ylab("") + 
  ggtitle("Mean Deaths Per 100 k")
```
To try to improve the accuracy of our model, we took the average average government spending and deaths per 100k for all recorded years for each country to try to even out any possible years that were creating outliers. This dataset proved to be no better fit for a linear regression model, so we continued the rest of our analysis with the original data set.

#### 2.12 Creating the Regression Model

```{r}
combined_dataset_lm <- lm(deaths_per_100k ~ gov_health_spending_usd , 
                          data = combined_dataset_long_cleaned)

broom::tidy(combined_dataset_lm)
```
#### Linear Regression Equation
Deaths_per_100k = 43.09345 - 0.01525(gov_health_spending_usd)

#### Interpretation
There is a negative correlation betweeb Deaths per 100K and Government Spending. Our model suggests that for every one unit increase in government spending, the deaths per 100k will decrease by 0.01525.
```{r}
summary(combined_dataset_lm)
```
With an R-squared value of about 0.051, our suspicions from the regression visualization are confirmed and our linear model is not a great fit for the data. Though our model is a poor predictor of the data trends, we can tell from our P-values (both < 2e-16) that there is a very strong correlation between these two variables.
